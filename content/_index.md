# Preface

I originally wrote this as a series of posts in 2014 after working
deeply with multiple Ruby applications. I decided to break out the
content from my old blog into this more structured format with an
independent life cycle. It's been editted a bit to read more like a
short book instead of a series of posts. I've not changed the
technical content though. That means the examples and referenced
libraries (like Virtus) are outdated. However the concepts discussed
in this work are still valid, important, and ultimately useful any
programmer who can internalize and act on these concepts.

I don't intend to rewrite this edition since it is frozen in time.  It
is my thoughts, as best as I could put them, on software design. This
work primarily focuses on applications but they're only a small
section of the wider spectrum of deployment pipelines, automation, and
infrastructure. Those facets are not represented here. My opinions on
software architecture have changed slightly since the writing but that
hasn't changed my adherance to the principles expressed in this work.
I still apply them every day and that made me a better programmer.

If you're more a a visual learner than I suggest you watch the video
of my talk "Rethinking Application Architecture". It covers all the
same high level concepts with minimal code examples. You can get
plenty of code examples and more technical context from the following
chapters.

Good luck out there and happy shipping!
