# Introducing the Domain

The first section covered delivery mechanisms. A delivery mechanism
exposes the application domain. The domain delivers an application
business value. It contains the business logic, features,
notifications and report generation for example. In short,
applications are nothing without their domain. This guide identifies
the use cases which implement functionality, entities which are the
core classes in the application, forms for mapping input to domain
objects, and persistence concerns. Consider it a primer on how to
engineer domain objects separate from the bigger boundaries in your
application.

First up, [form objects]({{< ref "form-objects" >}}).
